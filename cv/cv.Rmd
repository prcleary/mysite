<img src="rszpcid.jpg" alt="Paul Cleary" width="150"/>

Paul Cleary has been a consultant epidemiologist at Public Health England (and a predecessor organisation, the Health Protection Agency) since 2009. 

After over a decade as a hospital doctor in a variety of specialties including infectious diseases, and a period of research in the UK and Malawi, Dr Cleary undertook public health specialist training. He has considerable experience of working with infectious disease surveillance systems and has investigated numerous local, national and international infectious disease outbreaks. He has extensive teaching experience relating to epidemiology and statistics for the United Kingdom Field Epidemiology Training Programme (FETP) and the European Intervention Epidemiology Training programme (EPIET). 

His skills and interests relate to epidemiology, statistics, health informatics, antimicrobial resistance, tuberculosis, genomics, respiratory viruses and global health. He is an advanced user of R, Python, SQL, Git, Docker, DHIS 2 and Linux Web servers. He is currently providing technical support to projects on International Health Regulations compliance in Pakistan and Zambia. He is the national lead for influenza and respiratory viruses for the Field Service at Public Health England and previously held national lead roles for research and development and genomics.
