	abstract = {Background: Escherichia coli isolates producing extended-spectrum βlactamases (‘ESBL-E. coli’) cause {\textgreater}5000 bacteraemias annually in the UK. The contribution of the food chain to this challenge is debated. Methods: Selective media were used to seek ESBL-E. coli in routinely-submitted human faeces, sewage, farm slurry, and retail foodstuffs in London, East Anglia, Northwest England, Scotland and Wales. Recovered isolates were sequenced and compared with 293 bloodstream and 83 veterinary surveillance ESBL-E. coli isolates from the same regions. Findings: 10.7\% (2157/20243) of human faeces contained ESBL-E. coli, rising to 17.0\% (678/3995) in London. ESBL-E. coli also were frequent in sewage and present in 65.4\% (104/159) of retail chicken, but rare in other meats and absent from plant-based foods. Sequence Type (ST) 131 dominated among ESBL-E. coli from human blood (188/293, 64.2\%), faeces (128/360, 35.6\%) and sewage (14/65, 21.5\%) with STs 38 and 648 also widespread; CTX-M-15 was the predominant ESBL in these lineages. By contrast, STs 602, 23, 117 - mostly with CTX-M-1 ESBL - dominated among food and veterinary isolates, with only two ST131 organisms recovered. ST10 occurred in both animals and humans: being frequent in surveillance bovines and representing 4.2\% (15/360) of human faecal isolates (but only 1\% [3/293] from bacteraemias); however both human and animal ST10 isolates were diverse in serotype. Interpretation: Most human bacteraemias with ESBL-E. coli in the UK involve successful human-associated STs, particularly ST131; non-human reservoirs made little contribution to invasive human disease.

	abstract = {Summary
Background
In 2012, an outbreak of measles occurred in Merseyside, UK with 359 confirmed cases by 30 June. Numerous cases reported visits to healthcare and social settings.
Aim
To identify risk factors associated with measles transmission during the outbreak.
Methods
In April 2012, a retrospective matched case–control study was conducted. Fifty-five confirmed cases and 55 community controls, matched 1:1 for age and geography, were selected at random. Data on exposures in the two weeks before illness, including attendance at a healthcare setting, were collected via telephone interview. Univariate and multi-variate analyses were conducted and odds ratios were calculated.
Findings
Forty-two cases and 42 matched controls were contacted successfully. Univariate exact conditional logistic regression analysis identified that cases were more likely to have attended an emergency department, been admitted to hospital and be incompletely vaccinated (for age). Multi-variate analysis found three factors to be independently associated with measles infection: incomplete/partial vaccination for age [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 22.1, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 3.8–∞, P {\textless} 0.001], under age for routine vaccination (aOR 20.4, 95\% CI 2.0–∞, P = 0.009) and hospital admission (aOR 20.2, 95\% CI 1.4–∞, P = 0.025).
Conclusions
Incomplete/partial vaccination, under age for routine vaccination and hospital admission were associated with measles infection. These findings highlight the importance of timely vaccination of eligible individuals, early diagnosis, timely isolation of cases, and implementation of strict infection control measures.},

	abstract = {In August 2015, Public Health England detected an outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) serotype O157:H7 caused by contaminated salad leaves in a mixed leaf prepacked salad product from a national retailer. The implicated leaves were cultivated at five different farms and the zoonotic source of the outbreak strain was not determined. In March 2016, additional isolates from new cases were identified that shared a recent common ancestor with the outbreak strain. A case-case study involving the cases identified in 2016 revealed that ovine exposures were associated with illness (n = 16; AOR 8·24; 95\% CI 1·55-39·74). By mapping the recent movement of sheep and lambs across the United Kingdom, epidemiological links were established between the cases reporting ovine exposures. Given the close phylogenetic relationship between the outbreak strain and the isolates from cases with ovine exposures, it is plausible that ovine faeces may have contaminated the salad leaves via untreated irrigation water or run-off from fields nearby. Timely and targeted veterinary and environmental sampling should be considered during foodborne outbreaks of STEC, particularly where ready to eat vegetables and salads are implicated.},

Hospital wastewater sites are increasingly highlighted as important potential reservoirs. We investigated a large \textit{Klebsiella pneumoniae} carbapenemase (KPC)-producing \textit{E. coli} (KPC-EC) outbreak and wider CRE incidence trends over eight years in the Central Manchester Foundation NHS Trust (CMFT), UK, to determine the impact of Infection Prevention and Control measures.Bacteriology and patient administration data (2009 to 2017) were linked; a subset of CMFT/regional KPC-EC isolates (n=268) was sequenced. Control interventions followed international guidelines and included cohorting, rectal screening (n=184,539 screens), environmental sampling, enhanced cleaning, and ward closure/plumbing replacement. Segmented regression of time trends of CRE detections was used to evaluate the impact of interventions on CRE incidence.Genomic analysis (n=268 isolates) identified spread of a KPC-EC outbreak clone (ST216, strain-A; n=125) amongst patients and the environment, particularly on two cardiac wards (W3/W4), despite control measures. ST216 strain-A had caused an antecedent outbreak, and shared its KPC plasmids with other \textit{E. coli} lineages and \textit{Enterobacteriaceae} CRE acquisition incidence declined after W3/W4 closure and plumbing replacement, suggesting an environmental contribution. However, W3/W4 wastewater sites were rapidly re-colonised with CRE and patient CRE acquisitions recurred, albeit at lower rates.Patient relocation and plumbing replacement were associated with control of a clonal KPC-EC outbreak; however, environmental contamination with CRE and patient CRE acquisitions recurred rapidly following this intervention. The large numbers of cases and persistence of \textit{bla}$_{\textrm{KPC}}$ in \textit{E. coli}, including pathogenic lineages, is a concern.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Deprivation is associated with an increased risk of invasive Neisseria meningitidis disease, but little is known about the relationship between deprivation and asymptomatic carriage of N. meningitidis. This analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between meningococcal carriage and deprivation.
METHODS: As part of a rapid meningococcal carriage prevalence study conducted in West Cumbria to investigate an apparent cluster of invasive meningococcal disease, data were collected on lifestyle and social factors, including area-level indicators of socioeconomic status, to identify factors associated with meningococcal carriage.
RESULTS: In a multivariable log binomial regression model adjusted for age, lower socioeconomic status was significantly associated with higher prevalence of meningococcal carriage. A 1-unit increase in Index of Multiple Deprivation (2010) score was associated with a 1.7\% increase in meningococcal carriage prevalence (95\% confidence interval 0.3-3.0\%). Age was the only significant predictor of carriage of Neisseria lactamica.
CONCLUSIONS: Living in a deprived area is associated with increased carriage of Group B meningococcus. Deprivation is an important factor to consider in the evaluation of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the introduction of new meningococcal B vaccines and the development and implementation of immunization policies. Further work is required to understand whether deprivation has an effect on meningococcal carriage through other factors such as smoking.},

We used data from all five studies and interviews with members of each outbreak control team and market research panel provider to review operational issues, evaluate risk of bias in this approach and consider methods to reduce confounding and bias. The investigators of each outbreak reported likely time and cost savings from using market research controls. There were systematic differences between case and control groups in some studies but no evidence that conclusions on the likely source or vehicle of infection were incorrect. Potential selection biases introduced by using this sampling frame and the low response rate are unclear. Methods that might reduce confounding and some bias should be balanced with concerns for overmatching.

METHODS: Data were obtained from the UK General Practice Research Database on 4709 individuals who had seizures beginning at or after the age of 60 years, and on 4709 randomly selected controls with no history of seizures, matched for age, sex, and general practice. Individuals with a history of cerebrovascular disease, other acquired brain injury, brain tumour, drug or alcohol misuse, or dementia were not eligible for inclusion. Computerised patients' records were searched for subsequent diagnoses of stroke.
FINDINGS: Log-rank testing, adjusted for matching, showed a highly significant difference in stroke-free survival between the two groups (p{\textless}0.0001). With a Cox's model, we estimated that the relative hazard of stroke at any point for people with seizures compared with the control group was 2.89 (95\% CI 2.45-3.41).

Additional oil was given to some families; it may have improved survival but not nutritional status. Food supplementation to HIV/AIDS home based care patients and their families does not work well.

Potential biases arising from the method of control selection were identified in half of the studies assessed. There is a need to develop new ways of selecting controls in a rapid, random and representative manner to improve the accuracy and timeliness of epidemiological investigations and maximise the effectiveness of public health interventions. Innovative methods such as prior recruitment of controls could improve timeliness and representativeness of control selection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Information on geographical variation in localised transmission of TB can inform targeting of disease control activities. The aim of this study was to estimate the proportion of TB attributable to localised transmission for the period 2010-2012 in northern England and to identify case characteristics associated with spatiotemporal-genotypical clusters.
METHODS: We combined genotyping data with spatiotemporal scan statistics to define an indicator of localised TB transmission and identified factors associated with localised TB transmission thus defined in a multivariable logistics regression model.
RESULTS: The estimated proportion of TB cases in northern England attributable to localised transmission was 10\% (95\% CI 9\% to 12\%). Clustered cases (cases which were spatiotemporally clustered with others of identical genotype) were on average younger than non-clustered cases (mean age 34 years vs 43 years; p value {\textless}0.05). Being UK born (adjusted OR (aOR) 3.6, 95\% CI 2.9 to 6.0), presenting with pulmonary disease (aOR 2.2, 95\% CI 1.3 to 3.6) and history of homelessness (aOR 2.8, 95\% CI 1.2 to 6.8) or incarceration (aOR 2.6, 95\% CI 1.2 to 5.9) were independently associated with being part of a spatiotemporal-genotypical cluster in a multivariable model. Belonging to an ethnic group other than white or mixed/other was also significantly associated with localised transmission. We identified localised transmission in 103/1958 middle super output areas mostly in urban areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating highly discriminatory genotyping data into spatiotemporal analysis of TB incidence is feasible as part of routine surveillance and can provide valuable information on groups at greater risk and areas with localised transmission of TB, which could be used to inform control measures, such as intensified contact tracing.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Tuberculosis cohort audit (TBCA) was introduced across the North West (NW) of England in 2012 as an ongoing, multidisciplinary, systematic case review process, designed to improve clinical and public health practice. TBCA has not previously been introduced across such a large and socioeconomically diverse area in England, nor has it undergone formal, qualitative evaluation. This study explored health professionals’ experiences of the process after 1515 cases had been reviewed.

Design
Qualitative study using semistructured interviews. Respondents were purposively sampled from 3 groups involved in the NW TBCA: (1) TB nurse specialists, (2) consultant physicians and (3) public health practitioners. Data from the 26 respondents were triangulated with further interviews with key informants from the TBCA Steering Group and through observation of TBCA meetings.

Analysis
Interview transcripts were analysed thematically using the framework approach.

Results
Participants described the evolution of a valuable ‘community of practice’ where interprofessional exchange of experience and ideas has led to enhanced mutual respect between different roles and a shared sense of purpose. This multidisciplinary, regional approach to TB cohort audit has promoted local and regional team working, exchange of good practices and local initiatives to improve care. There is strong ownership of the process from public health professionals, nurses and clinicians; all groups want it to continue. TBCA is regarded as a tool for quality improvement that improves patient safety.

Conclusions
TBCA provides peer support and learning for management of a relatively rare, but important infectious disease through discussion in a no-blame atmosphere. It is seen as an effective quality improvement strategy which enhances TB care, control and patient safety. Continuing success will require increased engagement of consultant physicians and public health practitioners, a secure and ongoing funding stream and establishment of clear reporting mechanisms within the public health system.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza is a cause of considerable morbidity in England, particularly among children. A total of 39\% of all influenza-attributable general practitioner consultations and 37\% of all influenza-attributable hospital admissions occur in those aged under 15 years. Few studies have quantified the impact of influenza outbreaks on families. We assessed this impact during 2 influenza seasons.
METHODS: We used questionnaires to obtain data in primary schools that reported an outbreak of an influenza-like-illness (ILI). We sought data on the loss of productivity, costs borne by families and loss in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). ILIs were identified using the symptoms criteria from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the UK Flusurvey.
RESULTS: For each child reporting ILI, mean school absence was 3.8 days (95\% confidence interval [CI]): 3.0-4.8) with mean work absence for caregivers reported as 3.7 days (95\% CI: 2.7-4.8). The mean loss in HRQoL was 2.1 quality-adjusted life days (95\% CI: 1.5-2.7). The estimated total pediatric burden of disease for reported school-based outbreaks during the 2 influenza seasons was 105.3 QALYs (95\% CI: 77.7-139.0).
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the potential social and economic benefit of vaccination of children during mild influenza seasons.},

	abstract = {Patients with TB have diverse and often challenging clinical and social needs that may hamper successful treatment outcomes. Understanding the need for additional support during treatment (enhanced case management, or ECM) is important for workforce capacity planning. North West England TB Cohort Audit (TBCA) has introduced a 4-level ECM classification system (ECM 0–3) to quantify the need for ECM in the region. This study describes the data from the first 2 years of ECM classification. Data collected between April 2013 and July 2015 were used to analyse the proportions of patients allocated to each ECM level and the prevalence of social and clinical factors indicating need for ECM. Single variable and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to examine the association between ECM level and treatment outcome. Of 1714 notified cases 99.8\% were assigned an ECM level: 31\% ECM1, 19\% ECM2 and 14\% ECM3. The most common factors indicating need for ECM were language barriers (20.3\%) and clinical complexity (16.9\%). 1342/1493 (89.9\%) of drug-sensitive, non-CNS cases completed treatment within 12 months. Patients in ECM2 and 3 were less likely to complete treatment at 12 months than patients in ECM0 (adjusted OR 0.47 [95\% CI 0.27–0.84] and 0.23 [0.13–0.41] respectively). Use of TBCA to quantify different levels of need for ECM is feasible and has demonstrated that social and clinical complexity is common in the region. Results will inform regional workforce planning and assist development of innovative methods to improve treatment outcomes in these vulnerable groups.},

Aqueous zanamivir solution, an investigational product, was provided by the manufacturer on compassionate grounds for parenteral administration to severe H1N1pdm09 influenza cases during the 2009 pandemic.

Objective
To describe characteristics and outcomes of UK patients receiving parenteral zanamivir therapy.

Methods
Collaborators at multiple hospital sites gathered retrospective data on patients receiving aqueous zanamivir therapy between Q4 2009 and Q1 2011. We present analysis of the demographics, clinical features, treatment and outcomes of this cohort.

Results
Data on 185 cases were obtained (response rate of 38\%; median age 43 years; 62\% male; 17\% non‐Caucasian ethnic group). Most frequent co‐morbidities included cancer, immunosuppression and respiratory conditions. Most patients received intravenous zanamivir alone (90\%), for durations of up to 21 days. 13\% of cases had adverse effects related to zanamivir therapy. Thirty four percentage of cases died. No significant relationship was seen between mortality and timing or route of administration of aqueous zanamivir therapy.

Conclusions
The response rate of this observational study of the outcomes of treatment of severe influenza was low, allowing limited conclusions to be drawn. Some potential adverse effects were noted. Clinicians should carefully consider potential risks and benefits of use of this product. New treatment options are urgently required to improve outcomes for patients with severe influenza infections.},

	abstract = {Background: ESBL-producing Escherichia coli have expanded globally since the turn of the century and present a major public health issue. Their in vitro susceptibility to penicillin/inhibitor combinations is variable, and clinical use of these combinations against ESBL producers remains controversial. We hypothesized that this variability related to co-production of OXA-1 penicillinase.
Methods: During a national study we collected 293 ESBL-producing E. coli from bacteraemias, determined MICs by BSAC agar dilution, and undertook genomic sequencing with Illumina methodology.
Results: The collection was dominated by ST131 (n = 188 isolates, 64.2\%) and blaCTX-M-15 (present in 229 isolates, 78.2\%); over half the isolates (159/293, 54.3\%) were ST131 with blaCTX-M-15. blaOXA-1 was found in 149 ESBL producers (50.9\%) and blaTEM-1/191 in 137 (46.8\%). Irrespective of whether all isolates were considered, or ST131 alone, there were strong associations (P {\textless} 0.001) between co-carriage of blaOXA-1 and reduced susceptibility to penicillin/inhibitor combinations, whereas there was no significant association with co-carriage of blaTEM-1/191. For piperacillin/tazobactam the modal MIC rose from 2 mg/L in the absence of blaOXA-1 to 8 or 16 mg/L in its presence; for co-amoxiclav the shift was smaller, from 4 or 8 to 16 mg/L, but crossed the breakpoint. blaOXA-1 was strongly associated with co-carriage also of aac(6')-Ib-cr, which compromises amikacin and tobramycin.
Conclusions: Co-carriage of OXA-1, a penicillinase with weak affinity for inhibitors, is a major correlate of resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam and co-amoxiclav in E. coli and is commonly associated with co-carriage of aac(6')-Ib-cr, which narrows aminoglycoside options.},

Every year, influenza poses a significant burden on the National Health Service in England. Influenza vaccination is an effective measure to prevent severe disease, hence, maximising vaccine coverage in the most vulnerable is a priority. We aimed to identify the extent to which socioeconomic status is associated with influenza-associated illness (IAI) and influenza vaccine coverage.

Design
Retrospective observational study using hospital episode statistics.

Setting
Merseyside, North-West of England, including the city of Liverpool.

Participants
Residents of Merseyside hospitalised with IAI between April 2004 and March 2016, and Merseyside general practice registered patients eligible for influenza vaccination in 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 influenza seasons.

Exposures
Socioeconomic deprivation based on lower super output area English Indices of Deprivation scores.

Primary and secondary outcome measures
Incidence and risk of IAI hospitalisation, and vaccine uptake.

Results
There were 89 058 hospitalisations related to IAI among Merseyside residents (mean yearly rate=4.9 per 1000 population). Hospitalisations for IAI were more frequent in the most socioeconomically deprived areas compared with the least deprived in adults aged 15–39 years (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.08;95\% CI 1.76 to 2.45; p{\textless}0.001), 60–64 years (IRR 2.65; 95\% CI 2.35 to 2.99; p{\textless}0.001) and 65+ years (IRR 1.90; 95\% CI 1.73 to 2.10; p{\textless}0.001), whereas rates in children were more homogeneous across deprivation strata. Vaccine uptake was lower than the nationally set targets in most neighbourhoods. The odds of vaccine uptake were 30\% lower (OR 0.70; 95\% CI 0.66 to 0.74; p{\textless}0.001) and 10\% lower (OR 0.90; 95\% CI 0.88 to 0.92; p{\textless}0.001) in the most socioeconomically deprived quintile compared with the least deprived, among children aged 24–59 months and 65+ years, respectively.

Conclusions
Higher rates of IAI hospitalisations and lower vaccine uptake in the most socioeconomically deprived populations suggest that health promotion policies and interventions that target these populations should be a priority.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the epidemiology of fatal pandemic influenza A(H1N1) cases in the United Kingdom (UK) since April 2009 and in particular risk factors associated with death. A fatal case was defined as a UK resident who died between 27 April 2009 and 12 March 2010, in whom pandemic influenza A(H1N1) infection was laboratory-confirmed or recorded on the death certificate. Case fatality ratios (CFR) were calculated using an estimated cumulative number of clinical cases as the denominator. The relative risk of death was estimated by comparing the population mortality rate in each risk group, with those not in a risk group. Across the UK, 440 fatal cases were identified. In England, fatal cases were mainly seen in young adults (median age 43 years, 85\% under 65 years), unlike for seasonal influenza. The majority (77\%) of cases for whom data were available (n=308) had underlying risk factors for severe disease. The CFR in those aged 65 years or over was nine per 1,000 clinical cases (range 3-26) compared to 0.4 (range 0.2 to 0.9) for those aged six months to 64 years. In the age group between six month and 64 years, the relative risk for fatal illness for those in a risk group was 18. The population attributable fractions in this age group were highest for chronic neurological disease (24\%), immunosuppression (16\%) and respiratory disease (15\%). The results highlight the importance of early targeted effective intervention programmes. .},

A series of epidemiological studies (case–control, case–case, ingredients-based and venue-based studies) and supply chain investigations implicated mixed salad leaves from Supplier A as the likely outbreak vehicle. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) indicated a link with strains from the Mediterranean and informed the outbreak control team to request that Supplier A cease distributing salad leaves imported from Italy. Microbiological tests of samples of salad leaves from Supplier A were negative. We were unable to confirm the source of contamination or the contaminated constituent leaf although our evidence pointed to red batavia received from Italy as the most likely vehicle. Variations in Shiga toxin-producing E.
coli surveillance and diagnosis may have prevented detection of cases outside the UK and highlights a need for greater standardisation. WGS was useful in targeting investigations, but greater coverage across Europe is needed to maximise its potential.},

Our aim was to investigate whether catering venues linked to cases were more likely to have used salad leaves from this supplier. We conducted a matched case–control study, with catering venues as the units of analysis. We compared venues linked to cases to those without known linked cases. We included 43 study pairs and obtained information on salad leaf products received by each venue. The odds of a case venue being supplied with salad leaves by Supplier A were 7.67 times (95\% confidence interval: 2.30–25.53) those of control venues. This association provided statistical evidence to support the findings of the other epidemiological investigations undertaken for this outbreak.

METHODS: Cross sectional study with interviews, laboratory tests (CD4 count, viral load, nevirapine plasma levels, transaminases) and data extraction from files.
RESULTS: A total of 422 (59\%) of the patients who started ART since 2000 were lost to follow-up. The 176 patients enrolled in the study had good virological and excellent clinical treatment results. The most common side effect was peripheral neuropathy. Nevirapine plasma levels were remarkably high and associated with successful virological treatment results. Two simple adherence questions pertaining to the use of medication in the previous 8 days corresponded well with nevirapine levels. The most important reasons for non-adherence were shortage of drugs in the hospital pharmacy and personal financial constraints.
CONCLUSIONS: (1) Many patients were lost to follow-up. (2) High nevirapine levels contributed to good therapy results in those studied. (3) Simple adherence questions predicted subtherapeutic nevirapine levels. (4) Antiretroviral drug supply needs to be uninterrupted and free of charge, to prevent avoidable non-adherence.},

Mortality and the incidence, duration and severity of common symptoms of patients in a defined population receiving home based care were measured over an eighteen month period. 358 patients, of whom 199 died, were studied. A third of patients died within 4 months of being first seen. About half the patients were unable to care for themselves on first assessment. Half were malnourished with a Body Mass Index (BMI) {\textless} 18.5 kg/m2. Most patients had a mixture of symptoms at presentation. These symptoms responded to treatment usually within a fortnight. However a small proportion (5\%) of patients suffered repeated episodes often as many as 6–9 times a year. Incidence rates are estimated. Symptoms which are alleviated by simple treatments are common. The patients in whom symptoms recur need a responsive home based care service. Population based estimates of incidence and duration of disease and the visit work load allow an assessment of home based care needs in an urban setting in Africa.},

Isolates from a number of persons affected by the UK outbreak, who had initially been tested by MLVA also shared this particular profile. Cases were defined as any person infected with S.

In total, 287 cases met the definition. Food traceback investigations in the UK and other affected European countries linked the outbreaks to chicken eggs from a German company. We undertook whole genome sequencing of isolates from UK and European cases, implicated UK premises, and German eggs: isolates were highly similar. Combined with food traceback information, this confirmed that the UK outbreak was also linked to a German producer. .},

Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are a growing problem in UK hospitals. Preventing transmission requires early detection. This study evaluates a new screening policy for patients with a history of blaKPC-associated CPE (KPC-CPE) in a higher incidence hospital. Previous policy assumed “once positive always positive”. New policy uses rapid screening and risk assessment. Results show most (76.5\%) patients with a history of KPC-CPE do not have detectable KPC-CPE on readmission or during their subsequent hospital stay but repeat screening after an initial negative result is required. The new policy takes a risk-based approach whilst prioritising isolation facilities in a higher incidence trust.},

	abstract = {Outbreaks of Salmonella Enteritidis have long been associated with contaminated poultry and eggs. In the summer of 2014 a large multi-national outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis phage type 14b occurred with over 350 cases reported in the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, France and Luxembourg. Egg supply network investigation and microbiological sampling identified the source to be a Bavarian egg producer. As part of the international investigation into the outbreak, over 400 isolates were sequenced including isolates from cases, implicated UK premises and eggs from the suspected source producer. We were able to show a clear statistical correlation between the topology of the UK egg distribution network and the phylogenetic network of outbreak isolates. This correlation can most plausibly be explained by different parts of the egg distribution network being supplied by eggs solely from independent premises of the Bavarian egg producer (Company X). Microbiological sampling from the source premises, traceback information and information on the interventions carried out at the egg production premises all supported this conclusion. The level of insight into the outbreak epidemiology provided by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) would not have been possible using traditional microbial typing methods.},

	abstract = {Health Protection: Principles and practice is a practical guide for practitioners working at all levels in public health and health protection, including those with a non-specialist background. It is the first textbook in health protection to address all three domains within the field (communicable disease control; emergency preparedness, resilience and response (EPRR); and environmental public health) in a comprehensive and integrated manner. Written by leading practitioners in the field, the book is rooted in a practice-led, all-hazards approach, which allows for easy real-world application of the topics discussed. The chapters are arranged in six sections, which begin with an in-depth introduction to the principles of health protection and go on to illuminate the three key elements of the field by providing: case studies and scenarios to describe common and important issues in the practice of health protection; health protection tools, which span epidemiology and statistics, infection control, immunisation, disease surveillance, and audit and service improvement; and evidence about new and emerging health protection issues. It includes more than 100 health protection checklists (SIMCARDs), covering infections from anthrax to yellow fever, non-infectious diseases emergencies and environmental hazards. Written from first-hand experience of managing communicable diseases these provide practical, stand-alone quick reference guides for in-practice use. Both the topical content of Health Protection: Principles and practice, and the clearly described health protection principles the book provides, makes it a highly relevant resource for wider public health and health protection professionals in this continually evolving field.},

	abstract = {Background: Diarrheal disease, which affects 1 in 4 people in the United Kingdom annually, is the most common cause of outbreaks in community and health care settings. Traditional surveillance methods tend to detect point-source outbreaks of diarrhea and vomiting; they are less effective at identifying low-level and intermittent food supply contamination. Furthermore, it can take up to 9 weeks for infections to be confirmed, reducing slow-burn outbreak recognition, potentially impacting hundreds or thousands of people over wide geographical areas. There is a need to address fundamental problems in traditional diarrheal disease surveillance because of underreporting and subsequent unconfirmed infection by patients and general practitioners (GPs); varying submission practices and selective testing of samples in laboratories; limitations in traditional microbiological diagnostics, meaning that the timeliness of sample testing and etiology of most cases remains unknown; and poorly integrated human and animal surveillance systems, meaning that identification of zoonoses is delayed or missed. Objective: This study aims to detect anomalous patterns in the incidence of gastrointestinal disease in the (human) community; to target sampling; to test traditional diagnostic methods against rapid, modern, and sensitive molecular and genomic microbiology methods that identify and characterize responsible pathogens rapidly and more completely; and to determine the cost-effectiveness of rapid, modern, sensitive molecular and genomic microbiology methods. Methods: Syndromic surveillance will be used to aid identification of anomalous patterns in microbiological events based on temporal associations, demographic similarities among patients and animals, and changes in trends in acute gastroenteritis cases using a point process statistical model. Stool samples will be obtained from patients’ consulting GPs, to improve the timeliness of cluster detection and characterize the pathogens responsible, allowing health protection professionals to investigate and control outbreaks quickly, limiting their size and impact. The cost-effectiveness of the proposed system will be examined using formal cost-utility analysis to inform decisions on national implementation. Results: The project commenced on April 1, 2013. Favorable approval was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee on June 15, 2015, and the first patient was recruited on October 13, 2015, with 1407 patients recruited and samples processed using traditional laboratory techniques as of March 2017. Conclusions: The overall aim of this study is to create a new One Health paradigm for detecting and investigating diarrhea and vomiting in the community in near-real time, shifting from passive human surveillance and management of laboratory-confirmed infection toward an integrated, interdisciplinary enhanced surveillance system including management of people with symptoms.

	abstract = {Objectives
To assess the association of antiviral prophylaxis and care home characteristics with the spread and severity of influenza-like illness in care homes with influenza outbreaks in North West England in the 2017/2018 influenza season.
Study design
This is a retrospective observational study.
Methods
Routinely collected outbreak surveillance data reported to Public Health England were extracted from health protection electronic records. Data included use of antiviral prophylaxis, influenza-like illness or confirmed influenza, hospital admissions and deaths. Care home characteristics were obtained from the Care Quality Commission website. Single variable analysis and multivariable logistic regression were used to examine associations between care home characteristics, antiviral prophylaxis and influenza-related outcomes.
Results
In the 109 homes, there were 3498 residents; of whom, 855 (24\%) developed an influenza-like illness. Antiviral prophylaxis was given to residents of 67 of the 109 care homes with outbreaks (61\%). A significantly higher attack rate was observed among residents of homes given antiviral prophylaxis (27\%) than among residents of homes not given antivirals (20\%) (P {\textless} 0.001). Significantly more deaths occurred in homes for people with learning disabilities and homes that received antiviral prophylaxis (P {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions
In homes given antiviral prophylaxis, there were a higher number of residents with influenza-like illness and deaths. To improve our understanding of the impact of antiviral prophylaxis use in real life, enhanced and timely data collection is needed for identification of temporal associations between exposure and administration of antiviral prophylaxis. Consideration needs also to be given to ensure people with learning disabilities are protected through the seasonal influenza vaccine and timely antiviral prophylaxis when appropriate.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer and contributes to a number of other cancers that affect both men and women. Vaccines exist that offer protection against the most common cancer-causing HPV types. In England, a school-based vaccination programme for girls has been in place since 2008 but vaccine coverage rates have declined since its introduction. Understanding variation between schools and between local authorities may help to inform quality improvement and guide policy development and commissioning. Methods: Cross-sectional, ecological analysis of vaccine uptake among 164 schools representing 13,127 children in eight out of ten local authorities in Greater Manchester. Logistic mixed effects regression models were used to test for associations between school level factors and vaccine uptake, while allowing for variation between local authorities. Results: In multivariable mixed effects models, lower vaccination rates were associated with: increasing numbers of children eligible for vaccination; increasing proportions of children eligible for free school meals; increasing proportions of children with English as an additional language; Ofsted inadequate ratings; Christian and Muslim faith schools; independent schools and special schools. Conclusions: Consistent with previous studies on vaccine uptake, this study identifies a number of factors that are associated with uptake of the school-based HPV vaccine programme. We also show that local authority variation remains after adjustment for the mix of schools in each area. This evidence may be used to guide vaccine providers, commissioners, and policymakers who want to increase uptake of the school-based HPV vaccine.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
