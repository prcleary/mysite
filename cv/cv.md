<img src="rszpcid.jpg" alt="Paul Cleary" width="150"/>

Paul Cleary has been a consultant epidemiologist at Public Health
England (and a predecessor organisation, the Health Protection Agency)
since 2009.

After over a decade as a hospital doctor in a variety of specialties
including infectious diseases, and a period of research in the UK and
Malawi, Dr Cleary undertook public health specialist training. He has
considerable experience of working with infectious disease surveillance
systems and has investigated numerous local, national and international
infectious disease outbreaks. He has extensive teaching experience
relating to epidemiology and statistics for the United Kingdom Field
Epidemiology Training Programme (FETP) and the European Intervention
Epidemiology Training programme (EPIET).

His skills and interests relate to epidemiology, statistics, health
informatics, antimicrobial resistance, tuberculosis, genomics,
respiratory viruses and global health. He is an advanced user of R,
Python, SQL, Git, Docker, DHIS 2 and Linux Web servers. He is currently
providing technical support to projects on International Health
Regulations compliance in Pakistan and Zambia. He is the national lead
for influenza and respiratory viruses for the Field Service at Public
Health England and previously held national lead roles for research and
development and genomics.

## Teaching and training

I have made a major contribution to the PHE Field Epidemiology Training
Programme, including: curriculum development; site supervisor for three
fellows; project support to other fellows; member of Advisory Group;
recruitment panel member for three rounds of recruitment; preparation
and delivery of sessions at several modules and project reviews,
particularly EPIET Multivariable Statistics (4x) and HCAI epidemiology
modules (3x); FETP training site visits; masterclasses.

Instrumental in development of courses including Advanced Outbreaks
course, time series analysis course, introductory R training, data
visualisation, automation of surveillance reporting and genomics. I
deliver lectures on infectious disease surveillance to the University of
Liverpool Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene course and the
University of Manchester Master of Public Health. I also teach on the
SORT-IT (Structured Operational Research Training Initiative) course. I
have also delivered several didactic lectures on surveillance to
colleagues in Pakistan.

Was previously seconded to Epiconcept to deliver time series analysis
training to senior ECDC epidemiologists

Wrote Essential Statistics and Epidemiology chapter and contributed to
epidemiological methods chapter for Oxford University Press “Principles
and Practice of Health Protection” textbook.

Have also delivered local and national training on: outbreak
investigation; informed consent; audit; statistics, incl. spatiotemporal
and Bayesian methods; research methodology; software including EpiData,
R, Git/GitLab, Shiny/Shiny Server, DHIS 2; data visualisation; report
automation; data cleaning; pathogen genomics; AMR; TB and influenza
surveillance
